<p>For my mashup project I have decided to recreate the Iron Throne chair that is commonly seen in the 
TV show Game of Thrones. The origins of the chair is that it is a pile of swords melted down with dragon 
fire and when the molten metal cooled, it formed the shape of a throne chair. According to the lore, this
chair is very big and heavy. I reflected this by making the chair occupies the majority of the image; 
thanks to my small height, the chair appears even larger. Instead of swords, my chair will be forged from
various video game firearms. I tried to use weapons that would be considered "iconic." Therefore I took
guns primarily from Halo, Gears of War, Mass Effect, and Fallout.</p>

<p>Before starting I had a picture of the original chair so I could make accurate placement with the guns 
and help form the shape of the chair. Since the throne is a symbol of ruling over a kingdom, what better 
idea than to put myself in that chair for I had the power to create it in the first place. The result 
turned out to be very amusing since I had a very smug look on my face as I appear to be looking down on my
nonexistent subjects. The semi-casual sitting pose goes well with my generally laid back appearance. The 
gun smoke came from the expression of "packing heat." The chair is packing so much "heat" that it must be
vented from the barrels at the top of the chair.</p>
