<p>One strategies of new media was a video of a group of people in a New York subway performing some kind of skit over a surveilance camera. During the skit, the performers would wear signs that said &quot;Big Brother is watching&quot; referencing George Orwell's 1984. The idea was that surveilance cameras are everywhere in our modern day society and that everyone can see what's happening on each and every camera. It is considered New Media because it is using the technology of surveilance with a cultural, societal, and politcal aspect in mind.  The group chose to reference 1984 because our society is slowly becoming how the world is like in the book whether we like it or not.</p>
