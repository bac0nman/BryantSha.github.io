<p>For the final project, I have created a sequel that concludes this epic saga I had created in the first game. I have learned a lot of things with this project such as trying to bite off more than you can chew. Unfortunately, I was unable to do any of the things I promised myself i'd do like put in audio. It turns out putting in audio is much more complex than pictures. Since I don't have a website to host my audio files I had no choice but, to scrap the idea. Though with the loss of that I tried to make up for it by adding in more writing. I tried too much that I didn't have any experience doing and as a result I had to cut corners a bit. After this project, I feel empathy for game developers and what is is like to make a sequel that does better than the original while still putting in new things at the same time. I hope you have fun and enjoy my witty writing.</p>
