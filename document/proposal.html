<p style="font-size: 20px">For this documentation project, I decided to make my own choose-your-own adventure style game. The story of the game would be the player, a college student, has just came home for spring break and you want to play some video games over the one week break. Unfortunately, because of mysterious circumstances, you find your keys to the computer room to be missing. As a result you embark on an epic journey to search your home for your computer room keys so you can quickly go play games. To give a more 'authentic' feel, I took advantage of being home during spring break to take some pictures to use for the game. Of course for privacy purposes, I only took pics of areas of the home that don't show very much of the home.</p>
<p>This would count as a work of new media art because I am making use of current technologies, like a website, in order to make a very simple game. The format of a website with multiple pages fits perfectly for a choose-your-own adventure style game.</p>
