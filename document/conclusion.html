<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px;">As an aspiring video game designer, this was very good experience for me because I just got to experience first hand what video game development is like. Although it was a very simple game it was still a game nonetheless and I just ran through the entire development process while working on this project. I've never really dove into coding until I took this class so I learned a lot of new things. This game helped reinforced why I chose my chosen career. Reason being because it makes me happy not only when I get praised for doing a good job, but also when I see people enjoying the stuff I make.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px;">I would like to give some of my thanks to my younger brother who acted as the hooded swordsman in the game. That part probably was the most difficult because I had to figure out how to have him pose to make it look as if he is doing what I had written in my passages. Another challenge I had initially was to use Twine, but once I learned the basics, it became really easy after that.</p>
