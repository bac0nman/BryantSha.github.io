<p>Since this game would be taking place within my own home, I decided to scout around the house a little bit deciding how and where the game will take place. I also drew a rough outline of my home in order to draw out a path of how the game will go and which rooms I will decide to use and what events will take place inside each room.</p>
<p>Thanks to the professor, I was able to find this cool little program called Twine that was designed to make little games just like this. The only actual research I had to do to make the game was to read up on the tutorials for Twine. For those who are wondering, I used the older version Twine 1.4.2 instead of the newer Twine 2. Reason for this being because my research found that 1.4.2 allows for much more control while Twine 2 attempts to simplify and make it user-friendly. The same reasoning can be used as to why I love PCs and hate Macs.</p>
