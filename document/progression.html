<p style="font-size: 20px">One of the most important things to consider when making a game is what your game will be and what will it be about. That was the very first step I did. I originally was going to have it take place within my dorm but, it doesn't feel like a home. Plus it's technically not my actual home anyway. Well here comes spring break and I got an idea to do it within my actual home in Sacramento. I also got an idea about making the game about me trying to find my computer room keys because that's what I planned to do over break.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px">The next step was to sketch out an outline of my house. I did this because it would help me plan out where to start and how I should the game be paced. Once I got that part down, it was time to start taking pictures. I had to take great care not to get a picture of anything &quot;too private&quot; and I usually had to take the same picture a few times because sometimes it was too blurry or didn't look good enough.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px">Now here comes the fun--and tedious--part, building the game itself. I used a free open source program called Twine to help me accomplish this task. Thankfully, no knowledge of coding is needed, though it does help to some degree. After studying its various tutorials over the internet, I was ready make the game. I decided to write the text based on the pictures I took and then tweak it in a way so it fits the plot of my game.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px">After a few hours of writing paragraphs, typing some code, and a little bit of play testing, I have the finished project I have now. As long as you got a good workable idea for a game, anyone can do it. Most important rule of a game is to make sure it's fun. Hopefully, I have accomplished that with this project.</p>
